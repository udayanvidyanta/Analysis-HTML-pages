# Analysis-HTML-pages
We pulled out some basic statistics from the collected data of various newspapers, which can be accessed from the navigation pane on the top. These satistics represent different variables, variable types and the frequency of occurrence of these variables in the newspaper (for example, we can see "what percentage of visualisations in Times of India were sports-based" or "what percentage of visualisations in Dainik Bhaskar were bar charts"). The Pearson and the Spearman correlation graphs at the end of each page shows how different variables are correlated. These statistics, however, do not tell how different variables are interdependant. Future work includes demonstrating the interdependability of variables. This would allow us to analyse richer details like "how many sports visualisations in Times of India were bar charts". The data collected can be analysed here.
